Consider a triangular mesh representing the surface of a sphere, see Fig-
ure 1a. A spherical mesh is called valid, if and only if each edge is shared by
exactly two triangles. Conversely, when the spherical mesh contains edges
that are shared by only one triangle, then it is called a non-valid mesh.
Figure 1b shows a non-valid mesh; non-valid meshes have holes, as the one
shown by the red arrow.
